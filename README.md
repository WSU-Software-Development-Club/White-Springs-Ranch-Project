# Setup for dev
## Angular
1. I only added the minimum files, no actual work. If you want to run it, do `cd frontend` from root dir. 
2. Then do `npm install` to install dependencies. Make sure you have NodeJS installed (most recent version)
3. Run `ng serve` to start it then open it in your browser

## Python
1. There is a working example here, follow directions in backend dir.
