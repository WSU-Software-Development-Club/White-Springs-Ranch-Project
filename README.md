# Fixing issues!
When you want to work on an issue, create a branch named [issue] -[your name]. This will allow everyone to see you are working on the issue and see your progress. Commit to your branch regularly and sumbit a pull request when you are done.

# Setup for dev
## Angular
1. I only added the minimum files, no actual work. If you want to run it, do `cd frontend` from root dir. 
2. Then do `npm install` to install dependencies. Make sure you have NodeJS installed (most recent version)
3. Run `ng serve` to start it then open it in your browser

## Python
1. There is a working example here, follow directions in backend dir.
